			<h1>Front-end web development</h1>
			<p>Front-end web development, is the practice of producing HTML,
				CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user
				can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated
				with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to
				create the front end of a website change constantly and so the
				developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
				developing.</p>

			<h1>HTML5</h1>
			<p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and
				presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and
				current version of the HTML standard. It was published in October
				2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to improve the
				language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it
				both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
				computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is
				intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level
				2 HTML [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5]</p>
